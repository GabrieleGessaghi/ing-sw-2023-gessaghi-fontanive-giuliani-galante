## Base functionalities:

###  - Complete rules

## Advanced functionalities:

### - Chat

### - Persistence

### - Resilience to disconnections

## Types of connections implemented:

### - Socket 

### - Rmi

## Game modes:

## Instructions on how to run the project with JAR:

 In the deliverables folder you will find a Client jar file for each operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows) and a Server jar file valid for all operating systems.
 You can execute the jar files in a terminal by typing:
 ```
 java -jar Client.jar/Server.jar
 ```
 Once you have started the server on one device, you can start the Client from any device. 

 After the Client has opened you will be asked if you want to use the TUI or GUI game mode. Once the mode has been chosen, the game will start.

 The game save file will be saved in the same folder as the Server.jar with the name "saved_game.txt"
